# Herakalka Autoclicker

A simple yet powerful autoclicker with a graphical user interface, built with Python and PyQt6.

## Features

-   **Simple Mode:** Set a custom click interval, choose a mouse button (LMB, RMB, MMB) or any keyboard key, use a key-hold mode, and click at specific screen coordinates.
-   **Minecraft Mode:** A clicker optimized for gaming, featuring CPS (Clicks Per Second) settings and a "humanize" function to mimic real player actions.
-   **Macros:** Record and play back any mouse and keyboard actions, with adjustable speed and repeat counts.
-   **Pixel Bot:** Automatically clicks when a pixel of a specific color is found within a selected screen area or the entire screen.
